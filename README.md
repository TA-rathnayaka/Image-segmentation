# U-Net for Autonomous Driving: Precision Image Segmentation

This project involves building a U-Net model, a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for precise and efficient image segmentation. The model is applied to predict labels for each pixel in an image, specifically from a self-driving car dataset.

Semantic image segmentation is the primary task, where the goal is to label every pixel in an image with its corresponding class. Unlike object detection, which identifies objects using bounding boxes, semantic segmentation provides a pixel-perfect mask for each object. In this project, the "Car" class is marked with a dark blue mask, and the "Person" class is marked with a red mask:


Semantic image segmentation plays a crucial role in self-driving cars, as it allows the vehicle to understand its surroundings in detail, enabling it to navigate roads, avoid obstacles, and make real-time decisions to ensure safety.
